### 1.2 短文

#### 1.2.1 第一篇

Even at the time of graduation, many college students may still not be sure what kind of job they really want to do. There are so many confusions in their mind. One of these confusions is about stability. Should they choose a stable job with little freedom of creativity or a challenging but inspiring job? Another confusion is about **interests**. Should they find a job which provides good welfare at the expense of interests, or should they choose a job they like but with less **decent** salary?

- [ ] interests **→** ==n. **爱好，兴趣**；利息；利益，好处；权益，股权（interest 的复数）==
- [ ] decent **→** ==adj. 像样的，尚好的；**得体的**，合宜的；<非正式>穿好衣服的；正派的，规矩的；待人宽厚的，和善的==

Several reasons are behind those above confusions. Social values have a great impact on the youngsters' choices. Right now, there is a trend of pursuing stability and high payment in society. Stability and high payment have become two of the most important standards for graduates to choose a job. Besides, another reason why some youngsters give up their **interests** when seeking jobs is that some of the jobs cannot provide them with what they **deserve**.

- [ ] deserve **→** ==v. 值得，应受==

My opinion is that college students should choose a job that **appeals** to them. When doing a job a person really likes, he or she would be full of energy and creativity. As a person **commits himself** to the job, payment would finally be satisfying, materially and mentally.

> 我的观点是，大学生应该选择一份自己感兴趣的工作。当做一个人真正喜欢的工作时，他或她会充满活力和创造力。当一个人致力于工作时，报酬最终会在物质上和精神上都令人满意。

- [ ] appeal **→** ==n. 呼吁，恳求；上诉，申诉；吸引力，感染力；（为慈善或正义事业的）募捐；启发，打动 v. 呼吁，恳求；上诉，申诉；**有吸引力**，引起兴趣；启发，打动==
- [ ] commits himself **→** ==承诺，保证：表示一个人愿意承担某项责任或行动。**致力于，投身于：表示一个人全身心地投入某项事业或活动**。==

Q10: What are graduating students confused about?  

Q11: What do some youngsters do if they can't get what they deserve from jobs?  

Q12: What's the author's advice about the choice of jobs?

#### 1.2.2 第二篇

Today, let’s talk about what is happening in schools in the United Kingdom. It’s awful that **school breaks** have continued to **diminish**. A quarter of English secondary schools now give pupils 35 minutes or less to eat their lunch, while afternoon breaks are close to extinction. Overall, primary children aged five to seven have lost 45 minutes of play time since 1995, while 11- to 16-year-olds have lost over an hour. At the same time, children report having less opportunity to socialize with friends outside school.

- [ ] school breaks **→** ==学校假期：指学校中的休息时间，通常是指学生在学期间的放假时间，如寒假、暑假、春假等。==
- [ ] diminish **→** ==v. 减弱，降低，减少；贬低，轻视==

It is believed that increasing anxiety over children’s safety has reduced opportunities for playing outside or unsupervised at weekends and evenings. The attractions of gaming and social media have contributed to a shift in **leisure**. Now we know that during the school day, some young people have been denied interactions. They have no chance to play games, run around or exchange news.

- [ ] leisure **→** ==n. 闲暇，业余时间；休闲活动 adj. 空闲的，有闲的；业余的==

School is for education, but social life is an important aspect of schooling. School is where people learn to make friends and get along with others. It’s during childhood that we develop our characters and interests as well as our ability to hold and express views. All this is part of the preparation for adult life. In other words, to pave the way for adulthood is the final purpose that social life serves in schools.

People of all ages need a chance to rest, and we should encourage children to grow up **regarding** this as their right. Most of those surveyed said lunchtimes made them “very happy indeed.” Grown-ups deserve that pleasure too.

- [ ] regarding **→** ==v. 看待，认为==

> 各个年龄段的人都需要休息的机会，我们应该鼓励孩子们在成长过程中把这视为他们的权利。大多数接受调查的人表示午餐时间让他们“确实非常高兴”。成年人也应该拥有那种快乐。

Q13: Which age group of children has lost play time of over an hour?  

Q14: What has contributed to the shift in leisure?  

Q15: What is the final purpose of social life for school children?

### 1.3 填空

Humans are not helpless in the face of **coronavirus**. There are many things you can do to improve your chances against this virus. First and foremost, follow the public health measures recommended to us, including hand washing, social distancing and avoiding large gatherings. These are really the best means of protecting yourself from exposure. Prevention remains the best medicine.

- [ ] coronavirus **→** ==n. 冠状病毒；日冕形病毒==

What else can you do to improve your odds of beating COVID-19 if you become infected? One key step is to **maximize** your health now before you get sick. Studies have shown that those at the highest risk are over 60 and have **preexisting** health problems like **diabetes**, obesity, heart trouble or lung disease.

- [ ] maximize **→** ==v. 使增加到最大限度；**最大限度地利用**，充分利用；使窗口最大化，全屏；求出……的最大值==
- [ ] preexisting **→** ==先前存在的；已有的==
- [ ] diabetes **→** ==n. 糖尿病，多尿症==

If you have these medical problems, you can choose to be **proactive** and address them with your fullest effort, start today. If you never take blood pressure medicine because you hate taking **pills**, start today. If you rarely check your blood sugars and have left your diabetes out of control, please get your sugars under control starting today. Next, stop smoking immediately. Try to lose 10 pounds this month and force yourself to walk at least a mile every day, starting today. Get your flu vaccine right now.

- [ ] proactive **→** ==adj. 积极主动的，主动出击的；前摄的（前一活动中的因素对后一活动造成影响的）==
- [ ] pills **→** ==n. 药丸（pill 的复数）；[药]丸剂==

Even people without medical problems should maximize their health. Exercise, weight loss, a healthy diet and good sleep are certainly beneficial to your body. By doing these simple things, you are sure to improve your **immunity**. In the face of this virus, even a very small amount of improvement in your overall health could be the difference between mild and severe symptoms, and for some, it could mean the difference between life and death.

- [ ] immunity **→** ==n. 免疫力；免除，豁免==
