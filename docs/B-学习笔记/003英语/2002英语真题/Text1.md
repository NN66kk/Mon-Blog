### 第一段

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify **shared** experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in **sympathy** with **their point of view**.  Depending on whom you are **addressing**, the problems will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may **refer to** the **disorganized** methods of their **secretaries**; **alternatively** if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.

### 第二段

Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ **convention**, of a story which **works well** because the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is **being shown around** by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, **grabs** his food and **stomps** over to a table by himself. “Who is that?” the new arrival asked St. Peter.  “Oh, that’s God,” came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks he’s a doctor.”

### 第三段

If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will **be in a position to know** the experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to **make a passing remark about** the **inedible** canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties. With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to **cut in** with humor **as** they will **resent** an **outsider** making **disparaging** remarks about their canteen or their chairman.  You will **be on safer ground** if you **stick to** **scapegoats** like the Post Office or the telephone system.

### 第四段

If you feel **awkward** being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural. Include a few **casual** and apparently **off-the-cuff** remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and unforced **manner**. Often it’s the **delivery** which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an **unbelieving look** may help to show that you are making a **light-hearted** remark.

### 第五段

Look for the humor. It often comes from the **unexpected**. A **twist** on a familiar **quote** “If at first you don’t succeed, give up” or a play on words or on a situation. Search for **exaggeration** and **understatement**. Look at your talk and **pick out** a few words or sentences which you can turn about and inject with humor.

> - unexpected **→** 想不到的，意外的
> - twist **→** 曲解，歪曲，**转变**
