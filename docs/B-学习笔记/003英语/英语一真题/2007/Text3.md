### 第一段

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could **count on** hard work and **fair** play to keep itself financially secure has been transformed by economic risk and new realties. Now a pink slip, a bad **diagnosis**, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.

### 第二段

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work,transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all **stripes** have debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the **side effect**: family risk has risen as well. Today’s families have budgeted to the limits of theirs new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the **parachute** they once had in times of financial setback—a **back-up** earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got **laid off** or fell sick. This "added-worker effect" could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families **weather** bad times. But today, a **disruption** to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

### 第三段

During the same period, families have been asked to **absorb** much more **risk** in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the **harsh** reality that they may **outlive** their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with **retirees** trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the **picture** is not any better. Both the **absolute** cost of healthcare and the share of it **borne** by families have risen—and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are **working against** the middle class family, as the **odds** of having a weak elderly parent—and all the **attendant** need for physical and financial assistance—have jumped **eightfold** in just one generation.

### 第四段

**From** the middle-class family **perspective**, much of this, understandably, **looks far less like** an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, **and a good deal more like** a frightening acceleration of the **wholesale** shift of financial risk onto their already **overburdened** shoulders. The financial **fallout** has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.
