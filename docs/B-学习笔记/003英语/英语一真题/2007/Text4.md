### 第一段

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally **sorted out** their worst **accounting** and **compliance** troubles, and improved their **feeble** corporation governance, a new problem threatens to **earn** them—especially in America—the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to **heads rolling** in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to **odd**, low-level IT staff to **put right**, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, **telecoms** and air travel, information protection **is now high on the boss’s agenda** in businesses of every variety.

### 第二段

Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year—from organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense **contractor** Science Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley—have left managers hurriedly **peering into** their **intricate** IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.

### 第三段

"Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset," says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. "The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for **on behalf of** shareholders". Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’s Columbia Business School. "Setting the proper investment level for security, **redundancy**, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one," he says.

### 第四段

The mystery is that this **should** **come as a surprise to any boss**. Surely it should be obvious to the **dimmest** executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and **hugely** expensive to restore—and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data **get into the wrong hands**.

### 第五段

The current **state of affairs** may have been encouraged—though not justified—by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went **astray**. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now **doing the rounds** in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the **theft** of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.

- [ ] do the rounds **→** ==为寻求政治支持而拜访（文中指一直处于审议的过程中）==
- [x] theft **→** ==n. 偷窃，盗窃；盗窃罪==
