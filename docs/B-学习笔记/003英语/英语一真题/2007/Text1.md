### 第一段

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup **tournament**, you would most likely find a **noteworthy** **quirk**: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the late months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be ever more **pronounced**.

What might **account for** this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain **astrological** signs **confer** **superior** soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen **capacity**, which increases soccer **stamina**; c) soccer-**mad** parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the **annual** **peak** of soccer mania; d) none of the above.

Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old **psychology** professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in "none of the above." Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. "With the first **subject**, after about 20 hours of training, his digit **span** had risen from 7 to 20," Ericsson recalls. "He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers."

### 第四段

This success, **coupled with** later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a **cognitive** exercise than an **intuitive** one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are **swamped** by how well each person "encodes" the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information **meaningfully**, Ericsson determined, was a process known as **deliberate practice**. Deliberate practice **entails** more than simply repeating a task. **Rather**, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.

### 第五段

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus **taken to studying** expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather **startling** **assertion**: the **trait** we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers—whether in memory or surgery, **ballet** or computer programming—are nearly always made, not born.
