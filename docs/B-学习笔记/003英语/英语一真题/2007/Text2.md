### 第一段

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement _Parade_ has featured a **column** called "Ask Marilyn." People are invited to **query** Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228—the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual **analogies**, to **envision** paper after it has been folded and cut, and to **deduce** numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit **confusing** when vos Savant **fields** such queries from the **average Joe** (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and **fondness**? Or what is the nature of luck and **coincidence**? It’s not obvious how the capacity to **visualize** **objects** and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have **eluded** some of the best poets and philosophers.

### 第二段

Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be **specified**, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?

- [ ] specific **→** ==adj. 明确的，详细的；特殊的，特定的==

### 第三段

The defining **term** of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although **variations** of them **populate** bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population **distribution** among age peers, rather than simply **dividing** the mental age **by** the **chronological** age and **multiplying** by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), **capture** the main **aspects** of IQ tests.

### 第四段

Such standardized tests may not assess all the important **elements** necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article "How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?", Sternberg **notes** that traditional tests best assess **analytical** and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. **Moreover**, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted **leadership** skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ **was** negatively **correlated with** leadership—that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has **toiled** through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.
