### 第一段

Many things make people think artists are **weird**. But the **weirdest** may be this: artists’ only job is to explore emotions, **and yet** they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

### 第二段

This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But **somewhere** from the 19th century **onward**, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, **phony** or, worst of all, boring, as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s flowers of **evil**.

### 第三段

You could argue that art became more **skeptical** of happiness because modern times have seen so much **misery**. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know **perpetual** war, disaster and the **massacre** of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much **damn** happiness in the world today.

### 第四段

**After all**, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely **dedicated** to **depicting** happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly **tracks** the **emergence** of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.

### 第五段

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and **literacy**, the most powerful mass **medium** was the church, which reminded **worshippers** that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for **worms**. **Given all this**, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.

### 第六段

Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news **anchors**, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines **feature** beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And since these messages have an **agenda**—to **lure** us to open our wallets—they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. "Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

### 第七段

But what we forget—what our economy depends on us forgetting—is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need art to tell us, as religion **once** did, _Memento mori_: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in **living with** it. It’s a message even more **bitter** than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

---

- [x] once **→** ==adv. 一次， 一回；**曾经，一度**==
- [ ] live with **→** ==1、与...... 共同生活：指与某人或某物共同生活在一起，可以是家人、室友或宠物等。2、**忍受**：指接受并适应某种不理想的情况，如病痛、困难或缺陷等。==
- [x] bitter **→** ==adj. 味苦的；**痛苦的**，辛酸的；激烈的，充满敌意的==
