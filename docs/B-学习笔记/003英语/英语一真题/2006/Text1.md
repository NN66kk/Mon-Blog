### 第一段

**In spite of** "endless talk of difference," American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is "the **democratizing** **uniformity** of dress and **discourse**, and the **casualness** and absence of **deference**" characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed into "a culture of consumption" launched by the 19th-century department stores that offered "vast arrays of goods in an **elegant** atmosphere. **Instead of** **intimate** shops **catering to** a knowledgeable **elite**" these were stores "anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act." The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.

### 第二段

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether **elevating** but is hardly **poisonous**. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of the population; in 1900, 13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three **indices** of assimilation—language, home ownership and intermarriage.

### 第三段

The 1990 **Census** revealed that "a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence." The children of immigrants **tend to be** **bilingual** and proficient in English. "By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families." **Hence** the description of America as a "**graveyard**" for languages. By 1996 foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.
