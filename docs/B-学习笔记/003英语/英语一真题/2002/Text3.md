### 第一段

Could the bad old days of economic decline **be about to return**? Since OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of **crude oil** has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last December. This near-tripling of oil prices **calls up scary memories of** the 1973 **oil shock**, when prices **quadrupled**, and 1979-1980, when they also almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the **headlines** warning of **gloom** and **doom** this time?

### 第二段

The oil price was given another **push up** this week when Iraq suspended oil exports. Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter **grips** the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the short term.

> - grip **→** 抓住，抓牢

### 第三段

**Yet** there are good reasons to expect the economic **consequences** now to be less severe than in the 1970s. In most countries the **cost** of crude oil now **accounts for** a smaller **share** of the price of petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to **four-fifths** of the retail price, so **even** quite big changes in the price of crude have a more **muted** effect on **pump prices** than in the past.

### 第四段

Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in the oil price. Energy **conservation**, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy, **energy-intensive** industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, **consultancy** and mobile telephones use far less oil than **steel** or car production. For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest _Economic Outlook_ that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies—to which heavy industry has shifted—have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed.

### 第五段

**One more reason not to lose** sleep over the rise in oil prices **is that**, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it has not **occurred** **against the background of** general commodity-price inflation and global excess demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic decline. The Economist’s commodity price index is **broadly** unchanging from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.

## 题目

### 31

The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is

[A] global inflation

[B] reduction in supply

[C] fast growth in economy

[D] Iraq’s suspension of exports

> 1. 两个词在原文中不是一件事，典型的拼凑原文；时间也对不上，文章说的是之前的事情，题目问的现在；文章说的结果，题目问的原因！
> 2. supply-cuts 的同义改写。
> 3. 定位在第二段，能对上！讲的不是一件事，但讲的是油价进一步提升的原因。
> 4. 不匹配，错因和上面一样，答非所问！

### 32

It  can  be inferred from  the text that the retail  price of petrol will go  up dramatically  if

[A] price of crude rises 

[B] commodity prices rise

[C] consumption rises 

[D] oil taxes rise

> - 这题显然是 D！

### 33

The estimates in _Economic_ _Outlook_ show that in rich countries

[A] heavy industry becomes more energy-intensive

[B] income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices 

[C] manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed

[D] oil price changes have no significant impact on GDP

> - result from **→** 原因来自于 ... 
> 1. 原文说的是新兴国家，答非所问！
> 2. 原文意思是收入的损失极少一部分来自油价波动。
> 3. 受压榨的使新兴经济体，题目问的是富有经济体，本选项可以直接跳过。
> 4. 正确选项！（往往和原文不太像，这个属于对原文的高度概括）

### 34

We can draw a conclusion from the text that

[A] oil-price shocks are less shocking now

[B] inflation seems irrelevant to oil-price shocks

[C] energy conservation can keep down the oil prices

[D] the price rise of crude leads to the shrinking of heavy industry

> 1. 正确
> 2. 段 1，与原文不符。
> 3. 原文说的是减少了石油的消耗，两者无关。
> 4. 原文说的是重要性下降，并不是萎缩；因果也不对应。

### 35

From the text we can see that the writer seems

[A] optimistic

[B] sensitive 

[C] gloomy 

[D] scared
