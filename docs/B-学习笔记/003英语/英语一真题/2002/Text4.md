### 第一段

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide **carry important implications for** how **medicine** seeks to relieve **dying** patients of pain and suffering.

---

- physician = doctor 常考这两个的同义改写。
- 写作应用:: 对 ... 具有重要意义 **→** carry important implications for ... 
- [x] carry important implications for ...  **→** ==对 ... 具有重要意义==
- [x] medicine **→** ==n. 药物，药剂；医疗，医学==
- [x] dying **→** ==临终的，垂死的==

---

### 第二段

Although it ruled that there is no **constitutional** right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect”, a centuries-old moral principle **holding** that an action having two effects—a good one that is **intended** and a harmful one that is foreseen—is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

---

- [x] constitution **→** ==n. **宪法**，章程；组成，构成，制定==
- [x] hold **→** ==v. 认为，相信；持有，拥有==
- [x] intended **→** ==adj. 预期的，打算中的==

---

### 第三段

Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high **doses** of morphine to control terminally ill patients’ pain, even though increasing **dosages** will eventually kill the patient.

---

- [x] doses **→** ==n. 剂量（dose 的复数）==
- [x] dosages **→** ==n. [药]剂量；用量（dosage 的复数）==

---

### 第四段

Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, **contends** that the principle will **shield** doctors who "until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients sufficient medication to control their pain if that might hasten death".

---

- [x] contend **→** ==v. 声称，主张，**认为**；竞争，争夺；处理，对付==
- [x] shield **→** ==v. 保护，庇护==

---

### 第五段

George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long as a doctor **prescribes** a drug for a **legitimate** medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. "It’s like surgery," he says. "We don’t call those deaths **homicides** because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their suicide."

---

- [x] prescribe **→** ==v. 开药方，开处方==
- [x] legitimate **→** ==adj. 合情合理的；合法的==
- [x] homicide **→** ==n. 杀人，谋杀==

---

### 第六段

On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been **fueled** in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying.

---

- [x] fuel **→** ==n. 燃料；v. 加燃料==

---

### 第七段

Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-**volume** report, _Approaching Death: Improving **Care at the End of Life**_. It identifies the **undertreatment** of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even **dishonor** the period of dying” as the **twin problems** of end-of-life care.

---

- [x] volume **→** ==n. 一卷，一册==
- [x] Care at the End of Life **→** ==临终护理==
- [x] undertreatment **→** ==处理不力==
- [x] dishonor **→** ==vt. 使蒙羞，使丢脸==
- [x] twin problems **→** ==双重问题==

---

### 第八段

The **profession** is **taking steps** to require young doctors to train in **hospices**, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.

---

- [x] profession **→** ==行业，职业==
- [x] taking steps **→** ==采取措施==
- [x] hospices **→** ==（晚期病人）护理所==

---

### 第九段

Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these **well-meaning** medical **initiatives** **translate into** better care. “Large numbers of physicians **seem unconcerned with** the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering”, to the extent that it **constitutes** “**systematic** patient **abuse**”. He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear...that painful deaths are **presumptively** ones that are incompetently managed and should result in license suspension”.

---

- [x] well-meaning **→** ==adj. 意图良好的==
- [x] initiative **→** ==n. 倡议；主动性，主动的行动==
- [x] translate into ...  **→** ==转化为 ...== 
- [x] seem unconcerned with **→** ==似乎对 ... 不关心==
- 如果遇到了名词 + 主谓，则后面的主谓直接就是定语从句！
- [x] constitute **→** ==v. 构成，组成==
- [x] systematic **→** ==系统的，有计划的（这里引申为**故意的**）==
- [x] abuse **→** ==n. 滥用；**虐待**==
- [x] presumptively **→** ==据推测==
- [x] license suspension  **→** ==吊销执照==

4. 后面那一句就是这个意思！
