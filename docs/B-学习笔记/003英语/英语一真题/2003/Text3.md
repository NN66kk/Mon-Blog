### 第一段

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems, **causing heightened concerns about** monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads **accounted for** under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series of mergers is completed, just four railroads will control **well over** 90 percent of all the **freight** moved by major rail carriers.

### 第二段

Supporters of the new supersystems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial cost reductions and better **coordinated** service. Any **threat** of monopoly, they argue, is removed by fierce competition from trucks. But many **shippers** complain that for heavy **bulk** commodities traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads **therefore** have them by the **throat**.

- 遇到转折词立即划开，重点所在！

### 第三段

The vast **consolidation** within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only one rail company. Railroads **typically** charge such"**captive**"shippers 20 to 30 percent more than they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they are being **overcharged** have the right to **appeal** to the federal government's Surface Transportation Board for rate relief, but the process is expensive, time consuming, and will work only in truly **extreme cases**.

### 第四段

Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers **on the grounds that** **in the long run** it reduces everyone's cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue, shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so, leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line. It's theory to which many economists **subscribe**, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which companies will flourish and which will fail."Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who wins and who loses in the marketplace?"asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who frequently **represents** shipper.

### 第五段

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be **hit** with a round of huge rate increases. The railroad industry as a whole, despite its **brightening** **fortunes**, still does not earn enough to **cover the cost** of the **capital** it must invest to keep up with its **surging** traffic. Yet railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street cheering them on. Consider the $10.2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail's net railway operating income in 1996 was just $427 million, less than half of the **carrying costs** of the transaction. Who's going to pay for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will, as Norfolk Southern and CSX increase their grip on the market.

- [x] keep up with ...  **→** ==与 ... 保持一致==
