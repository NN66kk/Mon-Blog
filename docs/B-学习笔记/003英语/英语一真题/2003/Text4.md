### 第一段

**It is said that** in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional. **Small wonder**. Americans’ life **expectancy** has nearly doubled over the past century. **Failing** hips can be replaced, **clinical** **depression** controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minute **surgical** procedure. Such advances offer the **aging population** a quality of life that was unimaginable when I entered medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure death—and our failure to **confront** that reality now threatens this **greatness** of ours.

### 第二段

Death is **normal**; we **are** genetically **programmed** **to** **disintegrate** and **perish**, even under ideal conditions. We all understand that **at some level**, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved. **Shielded** by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless. The most obvious example is **late-stage** cancer care. Physicians—**frustrated** by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient—too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

### 第三段

In 1950, the US spent $12.7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. Anyone can see this trend is **unsustainable**. Yet few seem willing to try to **reverse** it. Some scholars conclude that a government with **finite** resources should simply stop paying for medical care that **sustains** life beyond a certain age—say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and **infirm** "have a duty to die and get out of the way", so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential.

### 第四段

**I would not go that far**. **Energetic** people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond, and remain **dazzlingly** **productive**. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to be 53. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor is in her 70s, and former surgeon general C. Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s.These leaders are living proof that prevention works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-year-old, I wish to age as **productively** as they have.

### 第五段

Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. As a physician, I know the most costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that people in Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than we have. As a nation, we may be **overfunding** the quest for **unlikely** cures while **underfunding** research on **humbler** therapies that could improve people’s lives.

---

- overfund **→** ==v. 对 ... 提供资金过多==
- unlikely **→** ==adj. **不大可能发生的**；未必真实的==
