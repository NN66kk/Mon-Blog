### 第一段

To **paraphrase** 18th-century **statesman** Edmund Burke, "all that is needed for the triumph of a misguided cause is that good people do nothing." One such cause now seeks to end biomedical research because of the theory that animals have rights **ruling out** their use in research. Scientists need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public and **thereby** threatening advances in health knowledge and care. Leaders of the animal rights movement **target** biomedical research because it depends on public funding, and **few** people understand the process of health care research. Hearing **allegations** of cruelty to animals in research settings, many are **perplexed** that anyone would **deliberately** harm an animal.

### 第二段

For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights **booth** at a recent **street fair** was distributing a **brochure** that encouraged readers not to use anything that comes from or is tested in animals—no meat, no fur, no medicines. Asked if she opposed **immunizations**, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured that they do, she replied, “Then I would have to say yes.” Asked what will happen when epidemics return, she said, “Don’t worry, scientists will find some way of using computers.” Such **well-meaning** people just don’t understand.

### 第三段

Scientists must **communicate their message to** the public in a **compassionate**, understandable way—in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between animal research and a grandmother’s hip replacement, a father’s bypass operation, a baby’s vaccinations, and even a pet’s shots. To those who are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.

### 第四段

Much can be done. Scientists could “**adopt**” middle school classes and **present** their own research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, **lest** animal rights misinformation go unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research institutions could be opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive medical treatment. If good people do nothing, there is a real possibility that an **uninformed** citizenry will **extinguish** the precious embers of medical **progress**.
