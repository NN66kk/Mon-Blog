## 第一段

Wild Bill Donovan **would have loved** the Internet. The American **spymaster** who built the Office of Strategic Services in the World War Ⅱ and later **laid** the **roots** for the CIA was  **fascinated with** information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools **came to hand** in the “great game” of **espionage**—spying as a “profession.” These days the Net, which has already re-made such everyday **pastimes** as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan’s **vocation** as well.

## 第二段

The latest revolution isn’t simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen’s e-mail. That kind of electronic **spying** has been going on for decades. In the past three or four years, the World Wide Web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying. The **spooks** call it "open source intelligence," and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly influential. In 1995 the CIA held a contest to see who could **compile** the most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large **margin**, was a tiny Virginia company called Open-Source Solutions, whose clear advantage was its mastery of the electronic world.

## 第三段

Among the firms making the biggest splash in the new world is Straitford, Inc., a private intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the results of spying (covering nations from Chile to Russia) to **corporations** like energy-services firm McDermott International. Many of its predictions are available online at www.straitford.com

---

- [x] corporations **→** ==n. 公司，企业（corporation 的复数）==

## 第四段

Straiford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of **mutually** **reinforcing** tool for both information collection and distribution, a spymaster’s dream. Last week his firm was busy **vacuuming** up data bits from the far corners of the world and predicting a crisis in Ukraine. “As soon as that report runs, we’ll suddenly get 500 new internet sign-ups from Ukraine,” says Friedman, a **former** political science professor. “And we’ll hear back from some of them.” Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since it can be difficult to **tell** good information **from** bad. That’s where Straitford **earns its keep**.

---

- [ ] mutually **→** ==adv. 相互地，双方地==

## 第五段

Friedman relies on a **lean** staff of 20 in Austin. Several of his staff members have military-intelligence backgrounds. He **sees** the firm’s outsider status **as** the key to its success. Straitford’s **briefs** don’t sound like the usual Washington **back-and-forthing**, whereby agencies avoid **dramatic** declarations on the chance they might be wrong. Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its independent voice.

---

- [x] lean **→** ==精简的，效率高的==
- [x] see A as B **→** ==把 A 看成 B==
- [x] brief **→** ==n. 简报，摘要==
