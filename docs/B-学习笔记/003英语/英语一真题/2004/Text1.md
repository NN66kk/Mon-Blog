### 第一段

Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon **stumbled across** CareerBuilder, a job database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site’s "personal search agent". It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors **key in** job criteria such as location, title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is **posted** in the database. Redmon chose the keywords legal, intellectual property and Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, he got his first **notification** of an opening. "I struck gold," says Redmon, who E-mailed his resume to the employer and won a position as in-house **counsel** for a company.

With thousands of **career-related** sites on the Internet, finding **promising** openings can he time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the databases. But although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. **Narrowing** your criteria, for example, may work **against** you: "Every time you answer a question you eliminate a possibility," says one expert.

### 第三段

For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept—what you think you want to do—then broaden it. "None of these programs do that," says another expert. "There’s no career **counseling** **implicit** in all of this." Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip service to **keep abreast of** jobs in a particular database; when you get E-mail, consider it a **reminder** to check the database again. " I would not rely on agents for finding everything that is added to a database that might interest me," says the author of a job-searching guide.

### 第四段

Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite’s agent sends out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only three potential jobs—those it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in the database; job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them—and they do. "On the day after we send our messages, we see **a sharp increase in** our traffic," says Seth Peets, **vice** president of marketing for CareerSite.

### 第五段

Even those who aren’t hunting for jobs may find search agents **worthwhile**. Some use them to **keep a close watch on** the demand for their line of work or gather information on compensation to **arm** themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily **employ**ed, Redmon maintains his agent at CareerBuilder. "You always keep your eyes open," he says. Working with a personal search agent means having another set of eyes **looking out for you**.
