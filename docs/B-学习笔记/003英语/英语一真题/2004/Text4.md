### 第一段

Americans today don't **place a very high value on** intellect. Our heroes are athletes, **entertainers**, and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our children to get a practical education—not to pursue knowledge **for the sake of** knowledge. Symptoms of **pervasive** anti-intellectualism in our schools aren't difficult to find.

### 第二段

"Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual," says education writer Diane Ravitch. "Schools could be a counterbalance." Ravitch's latest book. _Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms,_ traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our schools, concluding they are **anything but** a counterbalance to the American **distaste** for intellectual pursuits.

- anything but **→** ==绝不是，远远不是==
- distaste **→** ==n. v. 反感，不喜欢==

### 第三段

But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them **vulnerable** to **exploitation** and control. Without the ability to think critically, to **defend their ideas** and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, "We will become a second-rate country. We will have a less civil society."

---

- vulnerable **→** ==adj. （身体或精神）脆弱的，易受伤的==
- exploitation **→** ==n. 剥削，压榨；开发，开采；（出于私利、不公正的）利用==
- defend one's ideas **→** ==捍卫某人的思想==

### 第四段

"Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege," writes historian and professor Richard Hofstadter in _Anti-intellectualism in American Life,_ a Pulitzer-Prize winning book on the roots of anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of our history, says Hofstadter, our democratic and **populist** urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of elitism. Practicality, common sense, and **native intelligence** have been considered more **noble qualities** than anything you could learn from a book.

- populist **→** ==adj. 平民主义的==
- native intelligence **→** ==先天智力==
- noble qualities **→** ==高贵的品质==

### 第五段

Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and **rigorous** book learning **put unnatural restraints on** children: "We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a **bellyful** of words and do not know a thing."Mark Twain's _Huckleberry Finn_ exemplified American anti-intellectualism. Its hero avoids being civilized—going to school and learning to read—so he can preserve his innate goodness.

---

- rigorous **→** ==adj. 僵化的，严格的==
- put unnatural restraints on ...  **→** ==人为限制 ...==
- bellyful **→** ==n. 满腹；满肚子；过量==

---

### 第六段

Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we **reluctantly** admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to **grasp**, **manipulate**, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, **ponders**, wonders, theorizes, criticizes, and imagines. 

---

- reluctantly **→** ==adv. 不情愿地==
- contemplative **→** ==adj. 沉思的，冥思的==
- grasp **→** ==v. 抓牢，握紧；**理解，领会**；抓住（机会）==
- manipulate **→** ==v. 操纵，摆布；运用==
- ponder **→** ==v. 仔细考虑，琢磨，沉思==

---

### 第七段

School remains a place where intellect is **mistrusted**. Hofstadter says our country's educational system is **in the grips of** people who "**joyfully** and **militantly** **proclaim** their **hostility** to intellect and their **eagerness** to identify with children who show the least **intellectual promise**."

---

- mistrust **→** ==v. n. 不信任，怀疑==
- in the grip of **→** ==受……控制==
- joyfully **→** ==adv. 高兴地，喜悦地==
- militantly **→** ==adv. 好战地；好斗地；强硬地==
- proclaim **→** ==v. （正式）宣告，（公开）声明；强调，声称==
- hostility **→** ==n. 敌意，对抗；强烈的反对，愤怒反抗；战斗，战争行动==
- intellectual promise **→** ==才智上的前途==
