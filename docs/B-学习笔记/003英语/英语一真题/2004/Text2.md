### 第一段

Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been **condemned** or made illegal. But one **insidious** form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those **as yet** unaware of such a disadvantage, **refers** to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.

### 第二段

**It has long been known that** a taxi firm called AAAA cars **has a big advantage over** Zodiac cars when customers **thumb** through their phone **directories**. Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbott has in life over Zoë Zysman. English names are fairly **evenly spread** between the **halves** of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K.

### 第三段

Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C **respectively**; and 26 of George Bush’s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more **striking**, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chrétien and Koizumi). The world’s three top central bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters. As are the world's five **richest** men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).

- [ ] striking **→** ==adj. 惊人的，异常的；引人瞩目的==

### 第四段

Can this merely be **coincidence**? One theory, **dreamt up** in all the spare time enjoyed by the alphabetically disadvantaged, is that **the rot sets in** early. At the start of the first year in **infant school**, teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their names. So **short-sighted** Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, and is rarely asked the improving questions posed by those insensitive teachers. At the time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have had **a lucky escape**. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, because they get less individual attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.

### 第五段

The **humiliation** continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their awards first; **by the time** they reach the Zysmans most people are **literally** having a ZZZ. **Shortlists** for job interviews, election **ballot** papers, lists of **conference** speakers and attendees: all tend to be **drawn up** alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they **plough through** them.

- [x] humiliation **→** ==n. 耻辱，蒙羞；丢脸的事，尴尬的场合==
