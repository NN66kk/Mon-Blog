### 第一段

**When it comes to** the slowing economy, Ellen Spero **isn't** biting her nails **just yet**. But the 47-year-old manicurist isn't cutting, **filing** or **polishing** as many nails as she'd like to, either. Most of her clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped **showing up**. Spero blames the softening economy. "I'm a good economic **indicator**," she says. "I provide a service that people can do without when they're concerned about saving some dollars." So Spero is **downscaling**, shopping at middle-brow Dillard's department store near her **suburban** Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. "I don't know if other clients are going to abandon me, too," she says.

### 第二段

Even before Alan Greenspan's admission that America's red-hot economy is cooling, lots of working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car **dealerships** to Gap **outlets**, sales have been **lagging** for months as shoppers **temper** their spending. For retailers, who last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last year's pace. But don't **sound any alarms** just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy's long-term prospects even as they do some modest belt-tightening.

Consumers say they're not in **despair** because, despite the **dreadful** headlines, their own **fortunes** still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, "there's a new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, **predominantly** fed by Wall Street bonuses," says **broker** Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as **frenzied** overbidding **quiets**. "Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three," says John Tealdi, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their ability to find and keep a job.

### 第四段

Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. **Potential** home buyers would cheer for lower interest rates. Employers wouldn't mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers **seem to have** been influenced by **stock-market** swings, which investors now view as a necessary **ingredient** to a sustained boom. Diners might see an **upside**, too. Getting a table at Manhattan's hot new Alain Ducasse restaurant **used to be** impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co. may still be worth **toasting**.
