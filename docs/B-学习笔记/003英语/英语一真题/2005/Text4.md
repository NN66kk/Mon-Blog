### 第一段

Americans no longer expect public **figures**, whether in speech or in writing, to **command** the English language with skill and gift. **Nor** do they **aspire** to such command themselves. In his latest book, _Doing Our Own Thing: The **Degradation** of language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care_, John McWhorter, a linguist and **controversialist** of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s **counter**-culture as responsible for the decline of **formal** English.

### 第二段

Blaming the **permissive** 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic **speciality** is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of "whom", for example, to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.

- [ ] permissive **→** ==adj. 放任的，纵容的==
- [x] permission **→** ==n. 同意，许可；许可证，书面许可==
- [ ] speciality **→** ==n. 专业，专长==

### 第三段

But the **cult** of the **authentic** and the personal, "doing our own thing", has **spelt the death of** formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the **modestly** educated **sought** **an elevated tone** when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most **well regarded** writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could **claim** real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, **spontaneity** over craft.

- [ ] authentic **→** ==adj. 真实的，可靠的==

### 第四段

Illustrated with **an** entertaining **array of** examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter **documents** is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive—there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think **straight** because we do not talk proper.

- [x] document **→** ==n. 文件，公文，文献 v. 记录，**记载**（详情）==
- [ ] straight **→** ==adv. **正确地**，清楚地；直地，直率地==

### 第五段

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large **chunks** of memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to **elaborate** speech that would seem old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and **proposes** no **radical** education reforms—he is really **grieving over** the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English "on paper **plates** **instead of** china". A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.

---

- [ ] chunk **→** ==n. 大块，厚块==
- [ ] elaborate **→** ==adj. 复杂的，详尽的；精心制作的 v. 详细说明，详尽阐述；精心制作==
- [x] propose **→** ==v. **建议**；打算，计划==
- [ ] radical **→** ==adj. 根本的，**彻底的**==
- [ ] grieve **→** ==v. （尤指因某人亡故而）感到悲痛；使伤心==
- [ ] grieve over ...  **→** ==为 ... 哀叹/悲伤==
- [ ] plate **→** ==盘子==
- [ ] A instead of B **→** ==是 A 而不是 B==
