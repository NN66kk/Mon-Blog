### 第一段

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he **has a reputation for** **slacking**, you might even be **outraged**. Such behaviour is regarded as "all too human", with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this **finely** developed sense of **grievance**. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in _Nature_, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.

### 第二段

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food **readily**. **Above all**, like their female human **counterparts**, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of "goods and services" than males.

- readily **→** ==adv. 轻而易举地，迅速地；**乐意地**，欣然地==

- counterpart **→** ==n. 对应的人（或事物）==

### 第三段

Such characteristics make them perfect **candidates** for Dr. Brosnan’s and Dr. de Waal’s study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange **pieces** of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting **in return for** its rock, their behaviour became **markedly** different.

- in return for ...  **→** ==作为……的报答==
- markedly **→** ==adv. 显著地，明显地==

### 第四段

In the world of capuchins grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was **reluctant** to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other **chamber** (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.

- reluctant **→** ==adj. 勉强的，**不情愿的**==
- chamber **→** ==n. 房间，室；会议厅，会所==

### 第五段

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of **righteous** **indignation**, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a **lesser** reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

- righteous **→** ==adj. **正直的**，公正的；正义的==
- indignation **→** ==n. 愤愤不平，**义愤**==
- lesser **→** ==更少的==
