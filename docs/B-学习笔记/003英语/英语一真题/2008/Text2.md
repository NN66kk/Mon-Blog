### 第一段

It used to be so **straightforward**. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to a **journal**. A journal editor would then remove the author’s names and **affiliations** from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it. **Copyright** **rested with** the journal publisher, and researchers **seeking knowledge of** the results would have to subscribe to the journal.

### 第二段

No longer. The Internet—and pressure from **funding agencies**, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by **restricting access to it**—is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes **heavy** reading for publishers who have, so far, made **handsome** profits. But it goes further than that. It **signals** a change in what has, until now, been a key element of **scientific endeavor**.

### 第三段

The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, **in part**, **upon** wide **distribution** and **ready** access. It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International **Association** of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide **specializing in** these subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in **some** 16,000 journals.

### 第四段

This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of **scholarly journals** are now online. **Entirely new** business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the report’s authors. There is the so-called big **deal**, where **institutional** subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through **site-licensing agreements**. There is open-access publishing, **typically** supported by asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional **repositories**. Other models exist that are **hybrids** of these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making **it freely available to** everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional **form** of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.
