### 第一段

While still **catching up to men** in some **spheres** of modern life, women appear to be **way ahead** in at least one **undesirable** category. "Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men," according to Dr. Yehuda, chief **psychiatrist** at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.

### 第二段

Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex **hormones** somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the **trigger** chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when **stressed-out** female rats had their **ovaries** (the female **reproductive organs**) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those of the males.

### 第三段

Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased "opportunities" for stress. "It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much more to cope with," says Dr. Yehuda. "Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men’s," she observes, "it’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they **become worn out** from it more **visibly** and sooner."

### 第四段

Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. "I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a **chronic** or repeated **nature**. Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds of **interpersonal** violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be **one-shot deals**. The **wear-and-tear** that comes from these longer relationships can be quite **devastating**."

### 第五段

Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish college. "I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much **frustration** that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better." Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. "It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt.I lived from paycheck to paycheck."

### 第六段

Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe **chronic stresses** Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of **obligations**, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to **diffuse** stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.

- [ ] chronic stresses **→** ==长期压力==
- [ ] obligation **→** ==n. 责任，义务==
- [ ] diffuse **→** ==v.扩散，四散；传播==
