## The Importance of Listening

In the modern fast-paced society, people are increasingly aware of the importance of social harmony. Meanwhile, listening plays a significant role in it. As a vital communication skill, the awareness of listening is becoming essential in the development of a harmonious society.

We should appreciate its importance from three aspects. First, it contributes to our performance in relevant aspects. Specifically, listening helps to achieve a win-win cooperation between speakers and listeners. It builds a bridge of understanding. Second, those who possess this quality can enhance the productivity of the whole society, or improve communication efficiency. Without listening, information cannot be exchanged smoothly. Finally, if we ignored the importance of listening, or if we failed to do this, we would sooner or later pay a heavy toll. Misunderstandings would arise and relationships would be damaged.

In brief, this skill is so significant that measures must be taken. First, the government should issue policies and the media should strengthen publicity to emphasize its value.
Second, schools should open relevant open courses to teach students how to listen patiently. Last but not least, we should aim to inject this indispensable skill into every individual's heart. The sooner we take action, the more benefits we will reap.

## Job Priority: Interest or Salary?

First of all, we must admit that making a correct choice determines success or failure. However, when the question turns to the specific issue of "whether to choose a job based on interest or salary," opinions vary from person to person.

We need to analyze the benefits of both sides. First, interest can help us work with great passion and tap into our potential. A job without interest is just like a bird without wings. By contrast, a high salary can help us improve our living standards and relieve economic pressure. It provides the material basis for our life. In my eyes, what suits you is the best. We should make the decision based on our own interests and long-term goals.

Considering that this matter is of great importance, the society should provide support. For instance, schools can offer open courses to give relevant knowledge and guidance. This is crucial for young people to make wise choices.

## Changes in College Students' Physical Exercise

As shown in the chart, the time spent on physical exercise increased from 30 minutes per day in 2018 to about 60 minutes in 2020. In my opinion, this data reveals a significant trend and reflects China's achievement in public health awareness.

Why does this trend occur? First, to quote Marx, "The economic base determines the superstructure." China's growing comprehensive national strength is the premise. With better living standards, more sports facilities are built. Second, this phenomenon can also be attributed to a shift of people's values and health consciousness. Students now realize that health is the capital of revolution.

In conclusion, this trend is inevitable in the future. As the vanguard of society, we should grasp the pulse of this trend and actively cope with challenges and opportunities.

## How to Handle the Relationship between Classmates

With the remarkable improvement of China's comprehensive national strength, people are increasingly aware of the importance of social harmony. Meanwhile, mutual understanding plays a significant role in it. It acts as a lubricant in the relationship between classmates.

We should appreciate its importance from three aspects. First, it contributes to a win-win cooperation between classmates. When we understand each other, we can help each other in our studies. Second, possessing this quality can enhance the harmony of the whole class, or improve communication efficiency . A friendly atmosphere promotes academic progress. Finally, if we ignored the importance of mutual understanding, or if we failed to do this, we would sooner or later pay a heavy toll . Arguments would arise and friendships would be broken.

In brief, this quality is so significant that measures must be taken. First, schools should open relevant open courses to teach students how to communicate effectively. Last but not least, we should aim to inject this indispensable virtue into every student's heart. The sooner we take action, the more benefits we will reap.

## Mobile Phone Addiction

With the rapid development of technology, mobile phones are everywhere. However, does this mean we should be addicted to them? No. With the improvement of living standards, people are increasingly aware of the importance of self-discipline, especially the awareness of using phones rationally. This awareness plays a significant role in young people's development.

We should appreciate its importance from three aspects. First, it contributes to our performance in studies and work. Using phones properly can help us acquire information efficiently rather than wasting time on games. Second, those who possess this awareness can enhance social productivity. A focused mind creates more value. Finally, if we ignored the importance of rational use, or if we were addicted to phones, we would sooner or later pay a heavy toll. Our health would suffer and our eyesight would decline.

In brief, this awareness is so significant that measures must be taken. First, the media should strengthen publicity to warn against addiction. Second, schools should open relevant open courses to guide students to form good habits. Last but not least, we should aim to inject this indispensable awareness into every individual's heart. The sooner we take action, the more benefits we will reap.
