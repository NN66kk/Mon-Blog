# 田静长难句 1-20

## 

DAY 1

It is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most big-city newspapers.

![Pasted image 20230306201808.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230306201808.png)

对于 40 岁以下的普通读者来说，在大多数大城市的报纸上能找到高质量的艺术评论已经达到了不可能的地步。

> +   定语从句的窍门是可以往前翻译。
> +   A of B 翻译为 **→** B 的 A
> +   It is difficult for sb. To do sth.（做某事对于某人来说是困难的）

* * *

## 

DAY 2

Of all the changes that have **taken place in** English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century, **perhaps** the most **far-reaching** has been the **inexorable** decline in the scope and seriousness of their arts coverage.

+   taken place in **→** 发生在
+   perhaps **→** 或许，可能
+   far-reaching **→** 影响深远的
+   inexorable **→** 无法阻挡的；不可遏制的

![Pasted image 20230307183355.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230307183355.png)

在过去 25 年间发生在英语报纸上的所有变化中，也许影响最深远的就是是艺术报道的范围和严肃性方面不可阻挡的减少。

> +   far-reaching 后面有个 changes 省略了。
> +   has been 是现在完成时，表示现在的之前一直是这样的状态。

* * *

## 

DAY 3

We are even **farther** **removed from** the **unfocused** newspaper reviews published in England between the **turn** of the 20 th century and the **eve** of World War II, at a time when **newsprint** was **dirt-cheap** and stylish arts criticism was considered an **ornament** to the **publications** in which it **appeared**.

+   farther **→** 更进一步地
+   removed from **→** 移除，远离
+   unfocused **→** 目的不明确的
+   turn **→** 开始
+   eve **→** 前夕，前一天
+   newsprint **→** 新闻用纸
+   dirt-cheap **→** 像土一样廉价的
+   ornament **→** 装饰物；点缀
+   publications **→** 出版物
+   appeared **→** 出现，发表

![Pasted image 20230308201346.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230308201346.png)

我们甚至更进一步远离了 20 世纪初和第二次世界大战前夕之间在英国发表的目的不明确的报纸评论，在那个时候新闻用纸廉价如土，流行的艺术评论被认为是它发表的出版物的装饰品。

> +   动词是表示被动的 **→** 非核心 **→** 不用看。
> +   黄色部分为介词提前的定语从句。

* * *

## 

DAY 4

Now the nation’s top **patent** court **appears** completely **ready** to **scale back** on business-method patents, which have been controversial **ever since** they were first **authorized** 10 years ago.

+   patent **→** 专利；专利权
+   appears **→** v. 似乎是
+   ready **→** 准备好
+   scale back **→** 缩减
+   ever since **→** 从那时到现在
+   authorized **→** 被授权

![Pasted image 20230314195036.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230314195036.png)

现在国家顶级专利法庭似乎是完全准备好去缩减商业方法的专利，商业方法专利自从十年前被批准以来一直存在争议。

> +   类似 nation’s 这种类型的名词所有格也算是修饰成分，找主干的时候可以不用看！
> +   注意 ever since 也是一个连接词，ever 作为副词修饰 since 作为一个整体！
> +   注意前半句的谓语动词是 appears！！

* * *

## 

DAY 5

**Curbs on** business-method **claims** would be a **dramatic** **about-face**, because it was the **Federal Circuit** itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 **decision** in the so-called State Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of **pooling** **mutual-fund** assets.

+   Curbs on **→** 对 ... 限制
+   claims **→** 所有权
+   dramatic **→** 戏剧化的；**巨大的**
+   about-face **→** 转变，逆转；转身
+   Federal Circuit **→** 联邦巡回法庭
+   decision **→** 判决
+   pooling **→** 名词作动词表示聚集成水塘，在这里是**聚集在一起**的意思
+   mutual-fund **→** 共同基金

![Pasted image 20230317185837.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230317185837.png)

对商业方法所有权的限制将会是一个巨大的改变，因为这是联邦巡回法庭自己在 1998 年所谓的“美国道富银行”的案件中的判决中引进的这个专利，该判决同意对共同基金资产集资的方式授予专利。

> +   有强调句成分！不要误判成从句了！！

* * *

## 

DAY 6

The Federal Circuit issued an unusual order **stating** that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court’s judges, rather than a typical **panel** of three, and that one issue it wants to evaluate is whether it should “reconsider” its State Street Bank ruling.

+   stating **→** 说明，声明（这里是非谓语**动词**，后面接的是宾语从句！
+   panel **→** 小组

![Pasted image 20230317192455.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230317192455.png)

联邦巡回法庭发布了一项不寻常的指令，该指令称本案件将会被法院所有的 12 个法官听审，而不是典型的三人小组法官，并且它想要评估的一个问题是：是否应该“重新考虑”其 State Street 银行的裁决。

> +   that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court’s judges 往前看这是个动宾，判定为宾语从句！
> +   并列之间词性相同，成分一致，这个是两个 that 从句平行并列！
> +   后面那个并列句是主主谓谓结构！
> +   one issue 后面是省略了连接词的定语从句。

* * *

## 

DAY 7

In his book *The Tipping Point*, Malcolm Gladwell **argues** that "social **epidemics**" are **driven** in large part by the actions of a tiny minority of special individuals, often called **influentials**, who are **unusually** **informed**, **persuasive**, or **well connected**.

+   argue **→** v. 主张，认为；提出
+   epidemic **→** n. 流行病，传染病；（迅速的）盛行，蔓延 adj. 盛行的，泛滥的
+   drive **→** 驱动；驱使
+   influential **→** adj. 有影响力的，有势力的 n. **有影响力的人**
+   unusually **→** adv. 特别地，极其，非常；异常地，不同寻常地
+   informed **→** 见多识广的
+   persuasive **→** 有说服力的
+   well connected **→** 连接的非常好的，这里表示人脉非常好的

![Pasted image 20230317194143.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230317194143.png)

在《引爆点》这本书中，马尔科姆·格拉德维尔提出“社会流行潮”很大程度上是由少数特殊个体的行为所驱使的；（这部分群体）通常被称为有影响力的人，他们往往见多识广、颇具说服力或者人脉广阔。

> +   A of B of C **→** C 的 B 的 A

* * *

## 

DAY 8

For a social epidemic to occur, however, each person so **affected** must then influence his or her own acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on; and just how many others pay attention to each of these people **has little to do with** the initial influential.

+   affected **→** 在这里看成是非谓语，表示受影响的
+   has little to do with ... **→** 和 ... 没多少关系

![Pasted image 20230318200948.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230318200948.png)

然而，针对一个要发生的流行趋势，每个受影响的人必须去影响他的熟人，这些熟人反过来再去影响他们的熟人，依次向下传播，但是又有多少人注意到这些人跟最初的有影响力的人是没什么关系的。

* * *

## 

DAY 9

They found that the principal **requirement** for what is called "global **cascades**" —the widespread **propagation** of influence through networks—is the **presence** not of a few influentials but, rather, of a **critical** mass of easily influenced people.

+   requirement **→** 要求；条件
+   cascade **→** 瀑布；水流
+   propagation **→** 传播，传达
+   presence **→** 出席；**存在**
+   critical **→** 至关重要的

![Pasted image 20230318203433.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230318203433.png)

他们发现被称作“全球瀑布流”（通过网络影响的广泛传播形成的潮流）的主要条件不是一小部分有影响力人的存在，而是容易受影响的这么一个至关重要的群体的存在。

> +   not ... But ... 平行并列结构很隐蔽，of 并列结构
> +   写作应用:: 针对于 ... 首要条件 **→** the principal requirement for ...
> +   写作应用:: ... 的广泛传播 **→** widespread propagation of ...

* * *

## 

DAY 10

The IASB says it does not want to act without **overall planning**, but the pressure to **fold** when it completes it reconstruction of rules later this year is strong.

+   overall planning **→** 全部的规划
+   fold **→** 本意是折叠，在这里表示**屈服**
+   reconstruction **→** 重建；**修订**

![Pasted image 20230325133319.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230325133319.png)

IASB 表示，它不想在没有整体规划的情况下采取行动，但当它在今年晚些时候完成它的规则修订时，它面临的压力是很大的。

> +   but 前面那段是主谓主谓结构，后半段是从句！
> +   fold 不是及物动词，后面 when 引导的从句为时间状语从句。
> +   状语从句插入到句子中间的时候，方便理解我们可以把它放在句首或者句尾进行翻译。

* * *

## 

DAY 11

The longest **bull run** in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic **note** with a **sale** of 56 **works** by Damien Hirst, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, at Sotheby's in London on September 15 th 2008.

+   bull run **→** 全称应该是 bull market run 表示上涨的市场（牛市）
+   note **→** 还可以表示音符，这里理解为语气词，翻译为结束性的标志
+   sale **→** n. 出售，销售
+   works **→** n. **作品**；工厂；工程结构

![Pasted image 20230325135223.png](lib\media\pasted-image-20230325135223.png)

2008 年 9 月 15 日伦敦苏富比拍卖行举办的"在我脑海, 美丽永恒”主题拍卖会上, 随着 Damien Hirst 的 56 件作品被售出, 一个世纪以来艺术品市场最长的牛市也戏剧性地落幕了。

* * *

## 

DAY 12

But the market **generates** interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous **egos**, **greed**, passion and **controversy** in a way **matched** by few other industries.
